It‚Äôs been a few years since I was on the high school varsity tennis team.  That was the extent of my athletic career, except for some college club games, but my tennis obsession hasn‚Äôt gone away. I recently read ‚ÄúWimbledon in eight charts ‚Äì from tie breaks to ticket costs‚Äù from Flourish.  The goal of the Flourish project was to analyze the history of tennis and Wimbledon, specifically through the use of charts and graphs. The charts and graphs that are used in this project include a scatter plot, line chart, bubble chart, projection map, sunburst chart, timeline, and a slope chart. These charts cover topics such as games won versus ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) point placement, number of men‚Äôs versus women‚Äôs tiebreaks, men‚Äôs versus women‚Äôs cash prizes, number of wins for men and women singles players, birthplace of Wimbledon winners, right versus left hand players, viewership and duration of Wimbledon matches over time, and cost of Wimbledon tickets over the years. As a tennis fanatic, I found this project to be especially interesting.  But I had a question as I read it  Who is this digital project made for? I would assume that this kind of digital project is meant for anyone who enjoys Wimbledon or just tennis in general. The graphs and charts that are used throughout this project help give the reader a better understanding of the game beyond the grass court. This digital project might also be for the average sports fan who is looking to get into tennis but wants to learn more about its history first. Besides the average tennis and sports fans, I don‚Äôt see how anyone else could find this information interesting. The project itself was created in anticipation of Wimbledon which took place earlier in the summer of this year. Overall, it seems as if this project was created more as a blog post with data visualizations rather than a scholarly article or project. This was most likely just created to give the average sports fan a deeper understanding of how data driven this game really is. In other words, I believe that this project was made for more fun learning purposes rather than scholarly learning purposes. What I love most about this digital project is the fact that it utilizes more than one dataset to give the reader a greater understanding of the game and not just certain aspects of it. Each of the diagrams used are unique in their own way and are fairly easy to understand. For example, one diagram that I especially find interesting is the cost of Wimbledon tickets over the years diagram. For this dataset, a slope chart was used to show the differential in ticket prices from Day 1 to Day 14 of Wimbledon over the years since 2002. The chart itself is very easy to understand and everything is labeled clearly so the reader can easily decipher the data. What is most fascinating to me is that center court has had the most expensive tickets on Day 14 for every year compared to Day 1, while court 1 has had the least expensive Day 14 tickets compared to the more expensive Day 1 tickets. Overall, I think this project on Wimbledon is successful in what it is trying to accomplish. It used numerous datasets with unique charts and graphs to represent them in a way that can be easily understood by the reader. Although I would not consider this scholarly, it definitely can help researchers collect important data on Wimbledon and perhaps provoke more interest in the sport of tennis.
